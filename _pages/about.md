I am the vice head a lecturer at the [department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science) at Aalto University, Finland. Until the end of 2020 I was a [James S. McDonnell (JSMF)](https://www.jsmf.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). There, I was a memeber of [The Social Dynamics and Well-Being (SocWeB) Lab](http://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/), where I worked with Prof. [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) and her team. Before that, I was a JSMF Postdoctoral Fellow at the Departyment of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki, where I worked with Prof. [Erkki Isometsä](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/erkki-isomets%C3%A4). Prior to that, I did a short-term postdoctoral work at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University, where I also completed my PhD in December 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Jari Saramäki](https://jarisaramaki.fi/). My doctoral thesis "Temporal Patterns in Human Behavior" can be found [here.](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/28892/isbn9789526077246.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

My interests are interdiciplinary. Most of my research work focuses on analyzing data generated by digital devices and paltforms (such as smartphones and social media) to understand behavioral patterns of their users. My work is at the intersection of data science, computational social science, and compuatational psychiatry.

I was the [ICWSM-2021](https://icwsm.org/2021/index.html) Social Media & Publicity Chair and served as Local & Social Chair for ICWSM-2020.
